![thumbnail](thumbnail.png "Screengrab")

This is a sample visualization used for training purposes. It uses the results from Flowminder models and creates an interactive visualization that allows for multi-dimensional filtering of many of the models variables. 

## Data Sources
This visualization uses data sources available on the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/group/nepal-earthquake) repository. The breakdown of sources are:

### Tabular data
* Flowminder results (August): https://data.humdata.org/dataset/population-movements-after-the-nepal-earthquake-v5-up-to-19th-aug-2015

### Boundaries
* Admin 0: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/nepal-admin-level-0-administrative-boundaries-cod
* Admin 4: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/nepal-admin-level-4-administrative-boundaries-cod

## Usage
After setup, run the `run.sh` script:

```shell
$ ./run.sh
```

This should start a loal HTTP server, usually on port 8080.
